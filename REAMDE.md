# GRAPHQL-SERVER
This is the backend of the rpg project, uses graphql, prisma and a lot of typesafety.

## Learnings
GraphQL is hard to establish end-to-end typesafety. I believe GraphQL is really fun to work with on the frontend, but the backend has a lot of boilerplate code which I am not a huge fan off.

I would use GraphQL for complex and deep API trees. The support for GraphQL is lovely with plugins from GraphQL Yoga, but there's a lot of connections and code generation that needs to be manually performed.
